Iowa Gambling Task (Modified Version)
======================

This repository contains the Modified Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), including a Persian version, developed by Farzad Soleimani and Parinaz Khosravani. This task is widely used in psychology and neuroscience to study decision-making under uncertainty and risk.

Overview
======================
The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is a psychological task designed to simulate real-life decision-making. Participants select cards from four different decks to maximize their winnings. Each deck is associated with different reward and penalty patterns, representing advantageous and disadvantageous strategies.

Our modified version introduces new features and flexibility while ensuring cultural relevance for Persian-speaking participants. The original task design is based on the work of Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, and Anderson (1994):

Bechara A., Damasio A. R., Damasio H., Anderson S. W. (1994). Insensitivity to future consequences following damage to human prefrontal cortex. Cognition, 50, 7-15.

Features
======================
1. Modified Version
Includes updated rules and mechanics to enhance adaptability for various experimental designs.
Adds the option for participants to pass or play specific decks, offering more nuanced decision-making dynamics.
Highlights one deck with a black arrow, drawing attention to it and adding a cognitive bias element to the task.
Adjusts reward and penalty structures for a more controlled examination of decision-making strategies.
2. Persian Version
Fully localized into Persian, making it accessible for Persian-speaking participants.
Accommodates cultural and linguistic differences while maintaining fidelity to the original task's objectives.
3. Flexibility
Easily configurable for different research purposes and participant groups.
Supports adaptations for both clinical and experimental research.
4. User-Friendly Interface
Simple and intuitive interface for both participants and experiment administrators.
Provides clear instructions in both English and Persian.
